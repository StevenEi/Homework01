01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Changes Made
I was given two files (a .css and .html) that required their code to be looked at and refactored. To do this, I began by replacing all <div> tags in the .html file with semantic tags so that
future readers of the code would have more insight into what each section meant as far as how it would be represented in the website. Then, I removed unnecessary class tags within the .html file
(such as "benefits" and "content") and added other semantic tags (such as <main> and <aside>) for the same reason as removing the <div> tags. Afterwards, I cleaned up the .css file by removing
any outdated references to classes that were removed from the .html file. I also added alt text for images in case the images were not loading for a user.Lastly, I made slight adjustments to the 
font sizes of the text in the different sections of the webpage.

## What I Learned
Doing this project helped me understand that even though code within a .html / .css file is functional, that doesn't make the code "good". Good code is both functional and intuitive for others as
far as knowing what sections of code apply to what parts of the webpage. With practice I hope to be able to write both functional and intuitive code quicker than I can today!
